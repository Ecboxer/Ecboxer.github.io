	    <p>The 2017-2018 Arts Survey Data has data about arts teachers, budgets, partnerships with cultural organizations and parental involvement in NYC public schools.</p>

	    <p>In an effort to gain greater context for this data, we can examine it in conjuction with publicly available ELA and Math state test results and demographic data.</p>

	    <p>My goals were to understand the state of arts programs in NYC schools, what variables affect the resources of arts programs, and whether arts programs have an effect on the academic performance of students.</p>

	    <p style="font-size:160%;"><a href="eda/art_education/arts_survey_2.html">Arts Supervisors</a></p>

	    <p>New York City public schools were asked whether their arts supervisor was employed full- or part-time. If their supervisor was full-time, schools clarified whether they were solely working on arts programs or had other responsibilities.</p>
	    
	    <p>In small schools, or under-resourced ones, faculty may be expected to wear many hats. In the simplest cases, physical education teachers lead gym and health classes. More extreme examples can have teachers with certification in, for example, English teaching classes in math or science. I do not assert that an arts supervisor must be employed full-time to run an effective program, but I am curious as to what features predict their employment status.</p>
